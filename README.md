# The People's Permacomputer Project

The People's Permacomputer (henceforth known as "the people's
computer", or "the permacomputer") is a project dedicated to
resourcing the specification, and then construction of a
'permacomputer'.

## What is a permacomputer?

A permacomputer is a computer which attempts to embody the virtues of
permacomputing.

Foundationally, permacomputing _itself_ is set of community practices
and traditions which shares a set of social and ecological values
inspired by the 70s land management and settlement design of
_permaculture_.

## What is the point of this project?

The people's permacomputer project is an attempt to _physically
realise_ a permacomputer.

This will involve not just the production of an actual model
permacomputer, but also the development of a list of suggested social
and cultural practices around computing that will, it is hoped, assist
in the continued human practice of electronic computing.

There are many different dialectical approaches to making an
introduction to the people's permacomputer. One thought experiment
that has proved especially popular and easy to grasp sums up the
mindset behind which we are functioning:

> Industrial society has collapsed. All semiconductor fabrication has
> ceased, society-wide electrification is no longer guaranteed. There
> is no longer any internet. Computing as it was once known in the early
> 21st century is impossible. You need a computer for a task. What do
> you do?

This project is a humble response to the challenge posed by the above
problem.

## Adventures in the traditions of computation

We seem to take it for granted that a computer in everyone's hand just
is democratic computing. Indeed, the ubiquity of contemporary
computation has been confused for 'democracy'.

As quickly as we marched towards computing for the masses, we marched
just as swiftly away.

### GNU

There do today however still exist flourishing movements which are
worthy of mention--although not exclusive in this honour, much of the
GNU movement is to be credited with _any_ sanity being preserved in
present-day mass computation.

### Hobbyist computing

The hobbyist computer movement of the 1970s was rich in ideas, and
courageous--sometimes breathtaking--in its efforts to allow the lay
person to realise their access to an electronic computer.

Need we speak of the heterogenous array of kit computers and their
attendant clubs and magazines? Some of mention are entire influential
computing platforms in their own right:

- Altair 8800.
- Apple I and II.
- Commodore 64 and the VIC-20.

### From minicomputers to microcomputers

One may even be able to recount the history of computing *before* its
entry into the mass consciousness. Computer architectures from (now
defunct) firms like DEC (Digital Equipment Corporation) still carry
enormous significance today.

Much of DEC's fascinating and progressive work culture is imprinted on
the fruits of their labour. Two models of computer from DEC in
particular, the PDP-8 and the PDP-11, are steeped in the corporation's
ethos: "do the right thing". 

Neither of these machines were of much relevance outside the academy
and industry, but they represent huge strides forward in human history
for the virtues that the people's computer committee see as necessary
for permacomputing.

In particular, the full plans and maintenance manuals for each token
computer were accessible alongside each physical device:

http://www.bitsavers.org/pdf/dec/pdp11/

When was the last time the entire structure of a modern smartphone was
exposed and made accessible to the user? Indeed, the devices we take
for granted today are deliberately obfuscated for the purpose of
unchecked economic profit.

## Mutual exclusion

There are many influential projects which attempt to address the same
set of values driving the people's permacomputer project. Some worthy
of note can be listed in no particular order:

- [Collapse OS](http://collapseos.org/).
- [uxn](https://100r.co/site/uxn.html).
- The [RC2014](https://rc2014.co.uk/) computer kit.
- Ben Eater's [6502 project](https://eater.net/6502) video series.

All of these projects are concerned with some subset of the principles
the permacomputer project holds dear. Collapse OS is software that
aims to be system agnostic, and assumes the previous acquisition of
some supported hardware.

The **uxn** ecosystem is rich and continues to flourish. However,
while this project shares much with our own concerns for
sustainability and the long-term persistence of electronic computing,
we diverge from **uxn** on one fundamental point: we aim to
_physically provide_ the community with complete systems that are
easily turned on and interrogated by the lay computer user.

That is not to say **uxn** does not also shine in such areas, but
**uxn** is (very consciously) an emulator. The people's computer
project aims to _quite literally place completed general purpose
computers into people's possession_.

While one horn of the dilemma may be expressed as "software without
dedicated hardware", the reverse can be said to be true of the
plerotha of projects similar to the RC2014, and Ben Eater's breadboard
6502 project. In _this_ case, it is "hardware without dedicated
software".

These two aspects of a general purpose computer--its own unique
physical construction, and its capacity to perform abstraction through
judicious programming--are usually siloed off from one-another
intellectually.

In this way, the people's permacomputer is an attempt to blend, and
thoroughly combine two previously mutually exclusive set of practices
which, even if they were only able to survive the collapse in part,
are invaluable when applied correctly.

## Permacomputing and hetereogeneity

Our research was long and laborious. When the results of our
information gathering started to become clearer, we discovered that it
was not appropriate to offer up one model of permacomputer, but
several.

1. Mike Bauer's [DREAM 6800](http://www.mjbauer.biz/DREAM6800.htm).
2. The DREAM's 'older brother': a more powerful permacomputer able to
   deal with more complex human demands.
3. Permacomputers constructed from salvage, such as e-waste. One such
   proof of concept we imagine demonstrating is the collection and
   repurposing of ESP32C3 microcontrollers from inside 'smart
   lighting'.
4. Permacomputers derived from popular off-the-shelf contemporary
   microcontroller kits, like the Arduino Uno or Mega.

Each of these four approaches manages to present a view of the
fundamentals of computing from a different perspective.
