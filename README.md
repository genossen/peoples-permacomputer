# The People's Permacomputer Project

The People's Permacomputer (henceforth known as "the people's
computer", or "the permacomputer") is a project dedicated to
resourcing the specification, and then construction of a
'permacomputer'.

## What is a permacomputer?

A permacomputer is a computer which attempts to embody the virtues of
permacomputing.

Foundationally, permacomputing _itself_ is set of community practices
and traditions which shares a set of social and ecological values
inspired by the 70s land management and settlement design of
_permaculture_.

## What is the point of this project?

The people's permacomputer project is an attempt to _physically
realise_ a permacomputer.

This will involve not just the production of an actual model
permacomputer, but also the development of a list of suggested social
and cultural practices around computing that will, it is hoped, assist
in the continued human practice of electronic computing.

There are many different dialectical approaches to making an
introduction to the people's permacomputer. One thought experiment
that has proved especially popular and easy to grasp sums up the
mindset behind which we are functioning:

> Industrial society has collapsed. All semiconductor fabrication has
> ceased, society-wide electrification is no longer guaranteed. There
> is no longer any internet. Computing as it was once known in the early
> 21st century is impossible. You need a computer for a task. What do
> you do?

This project is a humble response to the challenge posed by the above
problem.

## Intergenerational communication

We seem to take it for granted that a computer in everyone's hand just
is democratic computing. Indeed, the ubiquity of contemporary
computation has been confused for 'democracy'.

As quickly as we marched towards computing for the masses, we marched
just as swiftly away.

### GNU

There do today however still exist flourishing movements which are
worthy of mention--although not exclusive in this honour, much of the
GNU movement is to be credited with _any_ sanity being preserved in
present-day mass computation.

### Hobbyist computing

The hobbyist computer movement of the 1970s was rich in ideas, and
courageous--sometimes breathtaking--in its efforts to allow the lay
person to realise their access to an electronic computer.

Need we speak of the heterogenous array of kit computers and their
attendant clubs and magazines? Some of mention are entire influential
computing platforms in their own right:

- Altair 8800
- Apple I and II
- Commodore 64 and the VIC-20

### From minicomputers to microcomputers

One may even be able to recount the history of computing *before* its
entry into the mass consciousness. Computer architectures from (now
defunct) firms like DEC (Digital Equipment Corporation) still carry
enormous significance today.

Much of DEC's fascinating and progressive work culture is imprinted on
the fruits of their labour. Two models of computer from DEC in
particular, the PDP-8 and the PDP-11, are steeped in the corporation's
ethos: "do the right thing". 

Neither of these machines were of much relevance outside the academy
and industry, but they represent huge strides forward in human history
for the virtues that the people's computer committee see as necessary
for permacomputing.

In particular, the full plans and maintenance manuals for each token
computer were accessible alongside each physical device:

When was the last time the entire structure of a modern smartphone was
exposed and made accessible to the user? Indeed, the devices we take
for granted today are deliberately obfuscated for the purpose of
unchecked economic profit.

## The People's Permacomputer



One such model of computer that immediately proved attractive for the
purpose of a permacomputer is Mike Bauer's [DREAM
