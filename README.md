# The People's Permacomputer Project

The People's Permacomputer (henceforth known as "the people's
computer", or "the permacomputer") is a project dedicated to building,
and then eventually resourcing the specification, and then
construction of a 'permacomputer' which will: (a) be ultra-low power;
and (b) survive in storage for up to anywhere between 200 to 500 Earth
sol.
