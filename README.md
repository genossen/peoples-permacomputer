# The People's Permacomputer Project

The People's Permacomputer (henceforth known as "the people's
computer", or "the permacomputer") is a project dedicated to
resourcing the specification, and then construction of a
'permacomputer'.

## What is a permacomputer?

A permacomputer is a computer which attempts to embody the virtues of
permacomputing.

Foundationally, permacomputing _itself_ is set of community practices
and traditions which shares a set of social and ecological values
inspired by the 70s land management and settlement design of
_permaculture_.

## What is the point of this project?

There are many different dialectical approaches to making an
introduction to the people's permacomputer. One thought experiment
that has proved especially popular and easy to grasp sums up the
mindset behind which we are functioning:

> Industrial society has collapsed. All semiconductor fabrication has
> ceased, society-wide electrification is no longer guaranteed. There
> is no longer any internet. Computing as it was once known in the early
> 21st century is impossible. You need a computer for a task. What do
> you do?

This project is a response to the challenge posed by the above
problem. The purpose of this project is to design and then construct
computers that will be able to _survive a societal_ collapse.

A permacomputer for the people involves two radically differing
criteria of success, yet these requirements, paradoxically, cannot be
separated from one another--fulfilling _both_ these two criteria is
required for a successful project.

The first criterion is a computer which is well-engineered. The
computer offered up by this project aim to be easy to grasp upon
immediate interaction, and have a profound, transformational effect on
the power of the user's capacity for rational and critical thought.

Permacomputers must also be rugged and durable. An inoperable computer
is otherwise known in hacker circles as a "brick". The length of time
the project determined adequate for the "life span" of a permacomputer
is a duration far in excess of contemporary standards. The intention
behind this project's design was to allow communities of people to
possess and maintain a computer collectively.

It is difficult to provide an accurate estimate for exactly how many
years the life cycle of a permacomputer design can be. This project
suggests a life span beyond that of a human individual.

Despite this concern, this project assumes that are threats outside
the domain of engineering to the permacomputer, which would otherwise
possess indefinite operation:

The second criterion is to ensure that there continues to be a human
cultural tradition of electronic computing, or that this tradition may
be able to be rediscovered or reconstructed. The project does not want
to merely effect an engineering feat, but also transmit the cultural
memory of electronic digital computing into the future.

It is hoped that, should the project succeed, humanity will be able to
be saved from the grueling tedium of many forms of onerous economic
work. Without a computer, these necessary social roles would involve
either great effort, or be personally unfulfilling or degrading;
shameful.

## Mutual exclusion

There are many influential projects which attempt to address the same
set of values driving the people's permacomputer project. Some worthy
of note can be listed in no particular order:

- [Collapse OS](http://collapseos.org/).
- [uxn](https://100r.co/site/uxn.html).
- The [RC2014](https://rc2014.co.uk/) computer kit.
- Ben Eater's [6502 project](https://eater.net/6502) video series.

All of these projects are concerned with some subset of the principles
the permacomputer project holds dear. Collapse OS is software that
aims to be system agnostic, and assumes the previous acquisition of
some supported hardware.

The **uxn** ecosystem is rich and continues to flourish. This project
shares much with our own concerns for sustainability and the long-term
persistence of electronic computing, but we diverge from **uxn** on
one fundamental point: the **uxn** ecosystem is a virtual computer,
and while an actual one, is not intended to _be a physical one_. This
is a delicate point because the audiences between the different
projects are in many ways intersecting. That said, **uxn** is (very
consciously) an emulator. The people's computer project aims to _quite
literally place completed general purpose computers into people's
possession_.

While one horn of the dilemma may be expressed as "software without
dedicated hardware", the reverse can be said to be true of the
plerotha of projects similar to the RC2014, and Ben Eater's breadboard
6502 project. In _this_ case, it is "hardware without dedicated
software".

These two aspects of a general purpose computer--its own unique
physical construction, and its capacity to perform abstraction through
judicious programming--are usually siloed off from one-another
intellectually.

In this way, the people's permacomputer is an attempt to blend, and
thoroughly combine two previously mutually exclusive set of practices
which, even if they were only able to survive the collapse in part,
are invaluable when applied correctly.

## Adventures in the traditions of computation

We seem to take it for granted that a computer in everyone's hand just
is democratic computing. Indeed, the ubiquity of contemporary
computation has been confused for 'democracy'.

As quickly as we marched towards computing for the masses, we marched
just as swiftly away.

### GNU

There do today however still exist flourishing movements which are
worthy of mention--although not exclusive in this honour, much of the
GNU movement is to be credited with _any_ sanity being preserved in
present-day mass computation.

### Hobbyist computing

The hobbyist computer movement of the 1970s was rich in ideas, and
courageous--sometimes breathtaking--in its efforts to allow the lay
person to realise their access to an electronic computer.

Need we speak of the heterogenous array of kit computers and their
attendant clubs and magazines? Some of mention are entire influential
computing platforms in their own right:

- Altair 8800.
- Apple I and II.
- Commodore 64 and the VIC-20.

### From minicomputers to microcomputers

One may even be able to recount the history of computing *before* its
entry into the mass consciousness. Computer architectures from (now
defunct) firms like DEC (Digital Equipment Corporation) still carry
enormous significance today.

Much of DEC's fascinating and progressive work culture is imprinted on
the fruits of their labour. Two models of computer from DEC in
particular, the PDP-8 and the PDP-11, are steeped in the corporation's
ethos: "do the right thing". 

Neither of these machines were of much relevance outside the academy
and industry, but they represent huge strides forward in human history
for the virtues that the people's computer committee see as necessary
for permacomputing.

In particular, the full plans and maintenance manuals for each token
computer were accessible alongside each physical device:

http://www.bitsavers.org/pdf/dec/pdp11/

When was the last time the entire structure of a modern smartphone was
exposed and made accessible to the user? Indeed, the devices we take
for granted today are deliberately obfuscated for the purpose of
unchecked economic profit.
