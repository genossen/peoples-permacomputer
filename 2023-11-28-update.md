things i wanna do:

# permacomputer $0Ci4L M3D14Z

- fully update the @permacomputer@retro.social project social media,
  which means:
    - updating the [hackaday
      profile](https://hackaday.io/project/191174-the-peoples-permacomputer);
    - updating the master [project
      page](https://sr.ht/~vidak/peoples-permacomputer);
    - releasing a new statement on the mastodon profile.
    - (i think that covers it)

# the permacomputer hardware itself
 
- build the first MC6847 video display 'warmup' computer.
    - i have found three projects based on 6502 which make use of the
      MC6847 and have published their schematics. so far so good. when
      the parts arrive i have to trust my breadboards and little wires
      are of a sufficient quality as not to bounce and ring, we're
      dealing with sub-1 MHz TTL-level digital signals so.... maybe my
      dodgy tools and components will be good enough.

- build the first permacomputer prototype
    - the next step after i have honed my practicals skills on a
      simpler task is this: construct a custom video display for the
      permacomputer, based on the information contained in don
      lancaster's [cheap video
      cookbook](https://www.tinaja.com/ebooks/cvcb1.pdf) or
      [here](https://archive.org/details/donlancaster_cvcb1) if you
      wanna support the internet archive?
    - the reason for using custom logic for the display is the limited
      number of columns the MC6847--it is my hope to have 40 columns,
      not a mere 32. i wish i could say more, but the short story is
      this: using EEPROMs in place of discrete logic is the ticket to
      having a simple design.

# the permacomputer software

- it is still my plan to get lisp running on the permacomputer (much
  thanks @50htz@cathode.church üôè üôè)
    - to this end see [this
      disassembly](https://github.com/stardot/AcornsoftLisp) of
      [Acornsoft LISP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acornsoft_LISP)
      for the BBC Micro. the beeb is a 6502 machine. it is my hope it
      can be easily ported to the permacomputer and enable a suitable
      operating system environment.
    - the problem is, this will make the permacomputer more like the
      beeb. it may not be a simple matter of reproducing the memory
      map of the beeb--it could require reproducing large parts of the
      beeb data pathways inside the permacomputer. watch this space.
    - i do not want to get too involved in writing a lisp for the
      permacomputer, so i am postponing this possibility until the
      very last moment. if i have to do everything myself, sigh, i
      will.

# the overall 'permacomputing' approach

## what is a permacomputer? what does a permacomputer do? 

the ultimate goal of the project is to construct computers which will
last a _really_ long time, and still stay operational. 

## are you serious? 

i largely regard this project to be a piece of art. if someone finds
some practical use for what i am building, however, that would also
make me overjoyed.

## is this a kit project? 

it is my pipe-dream to end up manufacturing permacomputer units at a
kind of cottage-industry level, perhaps something for my worker's
co-operative to do--friendly computers. i want to make these babies
really, really cheap--if it's not cheap, it's not accessible to the
poor.

## why 80s TTL micro-electronics?

it should be taken as given that 80s micros are one of the last
generations of computers that people could have a hope of
comprehending and mastering every element of its specification, from
hardware to the top of the software stack.
